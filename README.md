# diabetes_clsfctn_trees
This project's purpose is predicting a person is diabetes or not. For this I had diabetes data, first I looked into data and understand it as much as I can. Then I looked if there is any missing values, there were so I handled them one by one. Then I checked outlier and took care of them. Then I took a look at features relations with target feature. After this insgiht I did some feature engineering. Then I applied scaling and encoding on features. I used decision tree, random forest, xgb and lgbm models for this project. I applied cross validation to the models and picked best performers. Then I used Grid Search to hyperparameter optimization and found best parameters. Applied cross validation again and compared them respect to evaluation metrics.
